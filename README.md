### Hi there 👋, I'm Sina
I'm a 24-year-old programmer, just graduated from Simon Fraser University in October 2025, with a bachelor's degree majoring in Computing Science. Me and my groupmates in different classes in school made some cool projects, which I am going to showcase on this page at the bottom. My favourite language to code in is C++ and Java. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed learning how to code in Assembly. What I liked about Assembly was how it is a low-level language, and we're directly manipulating the computer's architecture.

More about me, I also worked as a server at Earls Restaurant while I was studying. Working as a server made me more social, and it made it much easier for me to get out of my shell. I'd love to connect; my LinkedIn is at the bottom of this page.
